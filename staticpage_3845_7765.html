  <b>Keystroke logging</b>, often referred to as <b>keylogging</b> or <b>Keyboard Capturing</b>, is the action of recording (or logging) the keys struck on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_%28computing%29" title="Keyboard (computing)" class="mw-redirect">keyboard</a>, typically in a covert manner so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup>
 It also has very legitimate uses in studies of human-computer 
interaction. There are numerous keylogging methods, ranging from 
hardware and software-based approaches to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics" title="Acoustics">acoustic</a> analysis.<br><ul><li><b>Hypervisor-based</b>: The keylogger can theoretically reside in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware" title="Malware">malware</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypervisor" title="Hypervisor">hypervisor</a> running underneath the operating system, which remains untouched. It effectively becomes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine" title="Virtual machine">virtual machine</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Pill_%28software%29" title="Blue Pill (software)">Blue Pill</a> is a conceptual example.</li><li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28computing%29" title="Kernel (computing)">Kernel</a>-based</b>: A program on the machine '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser" title="Superuser">gets root</a>'
 and hides itself in the OS, and starts intercepting keystrokes (because
 they always go through the kernel). This method is difficult both to 
write and to combat. Such keyloggers reside at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_%28computer_security%29" title="Ring (computer security)">kernel level</a>
 and are thus difficult to detect, especially for user-mode applications
 who don't have root access. They are frequently implemented as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit" title="Rootkit">rootkits</a>
 that subvert the operating system kernel and gain unauthorized access 
to the hardware, making them very powerful. A keylogger using this 
method can act as a keyboard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver" title="Device driver">device driver</a> for example, and thus gain access to any information typed on the keyboard as it goes to the operating system.</li><li><b>API-based</b>: These keyloggers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking" title="Hooking">hook</a> keyboard <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" title="Application programming interface">APIs</a>
 inside a running application. The keylogger registers for keystroke 
events, as if it was a normal piece of the application instead of 
malware. The keylogger receives an event each time the user presses or 
releases a key. The keylogger simply records it.
<ul><li>Windows APIs such as <code>GetAsyncKeyState()</code>, <code>GetForegroundWindow()</code>, etc. are used to poll the state of the keyboard or to subscribe to keyboard events.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> A more recent example simply polls the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS" title="BIOS">BIOS</a> for pre-boot authentication <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_identification_number" title="Personal identification number">PINs</a> that have not been cleared from memory.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></li></ul>
</li><li><b>Form grabbing based</b>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_grabbing" title="Form grabbing">Form grabbing</a>-based keyloggers log <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_%28web%29" title="Form (web)" class="mw-redirect">web form</a>
 submissions by recording the web browsing on submit events. These 
happen when the user finishes filling in the form and clicks on the "OK"
 or "Submit" or "Go" or anything that indicates that you're finished. 
This records form data before it is passed over the Internet. .</li><li><b>Memory injection based</b>: Memory Injection (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-browser" title="Man-in-the-browser">MitB</a>)-based
 keyloggers alter memory tables associated with the browser and other 
system functions to perform their logging functions. By patching the 
memory tables or injecting directly into memory, this technique can be 
used by malware authors who are looking to bypass Windows UAC (User 
Account Control). The Zeus and Spyeye Trojans use this method 
exclusively.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> Non-Windows systems have analogous protection mechanisms that need to be thwarted somehow by the keylogger.</li><li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_sniffing" title="Packet sniffing" class="mw-redirect">Packet analyzers</a></b>: This involves capturing network traffic associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POST_%28HTTP%29" title="POST (HTTP)">HTTP POST</a>
 events to retrieve unencrypted passwords. This doesn't work if you're 
connected with HTTPS - in fact it was this kind of attack they were 
fighting when they invented HTTPS. Visit:http://bit.ly/1lguI4p to get protected today.</li><li><b>Remote access software keyloggers</b></li></ul>
<dl><dd>These are local software keyloggers with an added feature that 
allows access to the locally recorded data from a remote location. 
Remote communication may be achieved using one of these methods:
<ul><li>Data is uploaded to a website, database or an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</a> server.</li><li>Data is periodically emailed to a pre-defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address" title="Email address">email address</a>.</li><li>Data is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless" title="Wireless">wirelessly</a> transmitted by means of an attached hardware system.</li><li>The software enables a remote login to the local machine from the 
Internet or the local network, for data logs stored on the target 
machine to be accessed.</li></ul>
</dd></dl>
<p>Most of these aren't stopped by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure" title="HTTP Secure">HTTPS</a>
 encryption because that only protects data in transit between 
computers; this is a threat in your own computer - the one connected to 
the keyboard.</p><p>The only software of its kind...http://bit.ly/1lguI4p<br></p><br>
