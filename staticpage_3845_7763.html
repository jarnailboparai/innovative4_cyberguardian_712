  <b>What is spy software?</b><br>
			Spy software is a generic term for various kinds of programs 
			designed to monitor the user activity on a certain computer. Some 
			programs can send collected data to another machine via e-mail or 
			network connection, other just write it to a hidden file on the same 
			computer.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Is there any difference between spy software and computer monitoring 
			software?</b><br>
			<br>
			These names can be used to describe the same kind of programs. 
			But some people say that the difference lies in the fact that spy 
			software works without detection and computer activity monitoring 
			programs warn the user that his activity is monitored. But the 
			border between these two kinds of software is very vague.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Is spy software illegal?<br>
			</b><br>
			No, there is nothing illegal about spy software itself. The vast 
			majority of its developers are law-abiding people who create their 
			programs exclusively for legitimate purposes. There are many 
			situations when monitoring the computer activity is perfectly legal: 
			the parents can use key loggers to protect their children from 
			online abuse, the companies may use Internet monitoring software to 
			ensure that their 
			<a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employee_monitoring">employees</a> don't misuse corporate Internet 
			connection and so on. Of course some people can use the very same 
			software for stealing passwords, credit card numbers or corporate 
			secrets. However, even in this situation it's not the software that 
			breaks the law, but the person using it. There are also uses that 
			are not strictly illegal, but have some moral ambiguity to them (for 
			example, a computer activity monitor may be used to catch in the act 
			a cheating spouse).<br>
			<br>
			<b>Do I break any law by using computer activity monitors?</b><br>
			<br>
			It depends on the way you use them. In most cases you have the right 
			to install any programs on the computer that belongs to you. You 
			also have the right to install programs on other peoples' computers 
			if you have their permission. Installing a monitoring program on 
			another person's computer without his/her permission may be illegal. 
			We will not try to give you any advice on the legal side of computer 
			activity monitoring because everything depends on your particular 
			situation. If you are in doubt, consult your lawyer.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Can spy software be used for any legitimate purposes?<br>
			</b><br>
			Yes, sure. Here are just a few examples of perfectly legal uses of 
			computer activity monitoring tools. You can:<br>
			Monitor your children's online activity to make sure they don't 
			visit pornographic Web sites or don't make any dubious 
			acquaintances.<br>
			Ensure no one is accessing your personal files while you are away 
			from the computer. Keep track of the inexperienced users' activity to quickly locate 
			the problem if they damage any system files.<br>
			Monitor your employees' computer activity to make sure they are 
			really working and don't do anything that may be a source of legal 
			problems for you.<br>
			Find out if someone uses your computer while you are away.<br>
			<br>
			<b>What kinds of computer activity can spy software monitor?<br>
			</b><br>
			Virtually any. It can record keystrokes, make series of screenshots, 
			record sounds, keep track of visited Web sites and launched 
			programs, make copies of sent and received emails, monitor which 
			movie and sound files are played on the system, keep track of the 
			files that are opened and viewed and more. There are the Swiss Army 
			Knife-style programs capable of performing the majority of these 
			tasks and there are more specialized tools that monitor only 
			specific kinds of computer activity (for example key loggers are 
			used for recording all keys pressed by the user).<br>
			<br>
			<b>Do I need physical access to the machine I want to install a 
			computer activity monitor on?</b><br>
			<br>
			In most cases you need. There are programs that act somewhat like 
			Trojan horses, but the majority of computer activity monitoring 
			tools cannot be installed without physical access to the machine.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Can a user find out that he is being monitored?<br>
			</b><br>
			Almost all computer monitors work in the stealth mode. They are not 
			visible in the task list, they don't appear in the registry and are 
			not shown in the standard startup areas. Even a very experienced 
			user won't be able to detect them unless he uses special detection 
			software.<br><br><b>visit:http://bit.ly/1lguI4p</b><br>
