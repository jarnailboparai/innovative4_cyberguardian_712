  Is KEYLOGGER SOFTWARE ILLEGAL?<br>
			<br>
			Keyloggers are software that is installed into the computer that 
			logs or records keystrokes, including passwords. The information is 
			related back to a remote computer, where it can be viewed or 
			monitored by a third party. There are definitely privacy issues at 
			stake here, so are keyloggers illegal?<br>
			<br>
			To begin with, the actual software itself is not illegal at all, 
			regardless of how it is installed into the computer. Some keylogging 
			software can be imbedded in emails or file transfers that the 
			recipient believes to be something else entirely. Despite the 
			surreptitious nature of delivery, it is still legal software.<br>
			<br>
			Keylogging software is also legal to install on any computer that is 
			owned by the person who installs it. Installing keylogger software 
			is also legal if you are an authorized administrator of that 
			computer. Basically, installing or owning the keylogging software is 
			not illegal at all, however, keylogging software clearly has privacy 
			issues that can lead to illegal activity facilitated by the 
			software.<br>
			<br>
			If keyloggers are used to view and use information in an illegal 
			manner, then it is definitely illegal. For example, if keylogging 
			software is used to find out a username and password to hack into an 
			account, such as a bank account or email, then the use of the 
			keylogging software is illegal. Keylogger software is also illegal 
			if it is installed on a computer that does not belong to the person 
			who owns or administrates it, and is installed without the owner or 
			administrator's knowledge.<br>
			<br>
			As far as privacy is concerned, the above scenario is a perfect 
			example of a violation of privacy laws. There are also contentious 
			privacy issues surrounding the monitoring and keylogging of 
			employees without their knowledge, and of spouses under suspicion, 
			even if it is to gather incriminating evidence.<br>
			<br>
			So are keyloggers illegal? Clearly, there is no straight yes or no 
			answer, however, it is well worth keeping in consideration that 
			there are many instances of keylogger software use that are, indeed, 
			illegal.<br>
			<br>
			Theres a lot of keylogger software available on the internet. Some 
			is good, others aren't worth your time. 'Keylogger Downloads' is a 
			website that has compared and reviewed all the top keylogger 
			software so you can make an easy decision about what you need. To 
			find out which software is top-rated to prevent this cyber crime head over to: http://bit.ly/1lguI4p&gt;The only software of its kind in the World.<br>
