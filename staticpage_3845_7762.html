  <b>A keylogger</b> is designed to records the keystrokes made by a person using
 a computer.  Keyloggers can either be software (a program installed 
onto a computer) or hardware (a physical device that connects to the 
computer).  They are generally thought of as being malicious programs 
installed on a computer without the user’s knowledge, but they can also 
be installed intentionally for beneficial reasons.<br><p>Keylogging software is a type of program that is installed on a 
computer and usually runs in the background without the user’s 
knowledge.  This kind of software can not only record keystrokes, but 
some programs can even take screenshots, record both sides of an IM 
conversation, and record audio conversation as well (such as if the user
 is speaking to another person through Skype).  It can also track 
programs that are being used, websites that are being visited, and which
 user is logged into the computer.  Some of these programs will even 
send this information secretly via email to another computer.</p>
<p><b>Keylogging hardware</b> refers to physical devices that connect to a 
computer and record keystrokes.  These can be adapters that fit between 
the keyboard cord and the computer, or devices that go inside the 
keyboard itself.  The former can be detected with the naked eye, 
although the latter type would require opening the keyboard to see it 
inside.</p>
<p><b>Keyloggers </b>are often used maliciously by hackers.  Sometimes they are
 installed by a person who suspects their spouse of cheating on them.  
Other times they are knowingly installed by a user who wants to have a 
backup of emails or documents he was writing in the event of a power 
outage or program crash.  Regardless of the reason, becoming more aware 
of their presence can help prevent you from becoming a victim of one.
