  <p>The term of Invisible Key logger may refer to the name of a specific 
program, or it may simply refer to any software that operates without 
the user knowing, as in that sense it is essentially an invisible.</p><p>For a computer user is being monitored in secret, then it is easy to 
see why the person doing the monitoring would want to use a program 
which is running without the users knowledge.  After all, if you are 
trying to catch someone doing something they shouldn't be doing, it's 
best if they do not know they are being observed!
</p><p>When it comes to espionage and spying, stealth and invisibility is 
the name of the game, much as the stealth bomber sneaks into enemy 
territory unnoticed.</p>
<p>The one exception to using an invisible program is if someone is 
using it on themselves.  For example, some people may run them on their 
own computers to help them save work should their system or program 
crash before they had a chance to save their work or send an email or 
whatever they were working on.  Have you ever written a long email and 
then when you hit send you get taken to some error page, and then when
 you click back your email is gone?  If you were running a monitoring 
program in this situation you could just go retrieve everything you 
typed and save yourself the time of having to remember everything you 
wrote and type it again.</p>
<p>Some logging programs even have an invisible mode
